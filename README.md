## Introduction

This is a proof of concept that demonstrates the ability to share a Typescript package with core functionalities and business logic between an Angular web app and an Ionic mobile app.

Please check the Medium article [Hybrid mobile apps: sharing logic between Angular and Ionic apps](https://medium.com/@benorama/hybrid-mobile-apps-sharing-logic-between-angular2-and-ionic2-apps-7c32145b90d5#.m1x3vpyc0) for more info.

## Running the apps locally

```

Prerequisites:
* [Typescript 2.0+](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links)
* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io)
* [Ionic CLI](http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/)

Note: `ngrx-demo-core` module is shared between the apps with `npm link` but it could be published to `npmjs` and be used as a regular dependency.

### ngrx-demo-core module

First, compile `ngrx-demo-core` shared module.

It is based on official Ionic module template, which supports Angular's ngc and Ahead-of-Time compiling out of the box.
https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-module-template

```
# Go into core module directory
cd ngrx-demo-apps/core

# Install dependencies
yarn
# Or npm install

# Compile typescript into dist
yarn build
# Or npm run build

yarn link
# Or npm pack
# Or npm publish

# Note: during dev, you can use 'tsc -w'
```

The shared module is now installed locally and can be used in other local npm projects.

### ngrx-demo-web app

Install or link `ngrx-demo-core` shared module and run the web app.

```
# Go into web Angular2 app directory
cd ../web

# Install dependencies
yarn
# Or npm install

# Create a symlink from the local node_modules folder to the global shared module symlink
yarn link "ngrx-demo-core"
# Or npm install ../core/ngrx-demo-core-0.0.1.tgz (if you used npm pack)

# Run the web app locally
ng serve
```

### ngrx-demo-mobile app

As we did for the web app, install or link the `ngrx-demo-core` shared module and run the mobile app.

```
# Go into mobile Ionic2 app directory
cd ../mobile

# Install dependencies and typings (you can get a burger...)
yarn
# Or npm install

# Create a symlink from the local node_modules folder to the global shared module symlink
yarn link "ngrx-demo-core"
# Or npm install ../core/ngrx-demo-core-0.0.1.tgz (if you used npm pack)

# Run the mobile app locally
ionic serve
```
